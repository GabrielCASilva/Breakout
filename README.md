> ‚ö†Ô∏è This game is still a **work in progress**, but it's fully playable!

A simple clone of the classic **Breakout** game, made with **C++23**, **Raylib 5.5**, and **CMake**.  
Use `A` and `D` to move the paddle, **move the mouse** to aim the initial direction of the ball, and **left-click** to launch it.
